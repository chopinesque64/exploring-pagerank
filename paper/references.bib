  abstract = {A self-consistent methodology is developed for determining citation based influence measures for scientific journals, subfields and fields. Starting with the cross citing matrix between journals or between aggregates of journals, an eigenvalue problem is formulated leading to a size independent influence weight for each journal or aggregate. Two other measures, the influence per publication and the total influence are then defined. Hierarchical influence diagrams and numerical data are presented to display journal interrelationships for journals within the subfields of physics. A wide range in influence is found between the most influential and least influential or peripheral journals.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

We describe the contribution given by previous scholars in precise and modern mathematical terms: along the way, we show how to express in a general way damped rankings, such as Katz's index, as dominant eigenvectors of perturbed matrices, and then use results on the Drazin inverse to go back to the dominant eigenvectors by a limit process. The result suggests a regularized definition of spectral ranking that yields for a general matrix a unique vector depending on a boundary condition.},

We then provide examples which show that {$\lambda$}2(P) must, in general, be remarkable close to 1 before such uncoupling occurs.},

  title = {Graph Structure in the Web},
  abstract = {The study of the web as a graph is not only fascinating in its own right, but also yields valuable insight into web algorithms for crawling, searching and community discovery, and the sociological phenomena which characterize its evolution. We report on experiments on local and global properties of the web graph using two Altavista crawls each with over 200 million pages and 1.5 billion links. Our study indicates that the macroscopic structure of the web is considerably more intricate than suggested by earlier experiments on a smaller scale.},

  abstract = {In this paper we analyze decompositions of reversible nearly uncoupled Markov chains into rapidly mixing subchains. We state upper bounds on the 2nd eigenvalue for restriction and stochastic complementation chains of reversible Markov chains, as well as a relation between them. We illustrate the obtained bounds analytically for bunkbed graphs, and furthermore apply them to restricted Markov chains that arise when analyzing conformation dynamics of a small biomolecule.},

  abstract = {We observe that the convergence patterns of pages in the PageRank algorithm have a nonuniform distribution. Specifically, many pages converge to their true PageRank quickly, while relatively few pages take a much longer time to converge. Furthermore, we observe that these slow-converging pages are generally those pages with high PageRank. We use this observation to devise a simple algorithm to speed up the computation of PageRank, in which the PageRank of pages that have converged are not recomputed at each iteration after convergence. This algorithm, which we call Adaptive PageRank, speeds up the computation of PageRank by nearly 30\%.},

  abstract = {The web link graph has a nested block structure: the vast majority of hyperlinks link pages on a host to other pages on the same host, and many of those that do not link pages within the same domain. We show how to exploit this structure to speed up the computation of PageRank by a 3-stage algorithm whereby (1)\textasciitilde{}the local PageRanks of pages for each host are computed independently using the link structure of that host, (2)\textasciitilde{}these local PageRanks are then weighted by the ``importance'' of the corresponding host, and (3)\textasciitilde{}the standard PageRank algorithm is then run using as its starting vector the weighted aggregate of the local PageRanks.  Empirically, this algorithm speeds up the computation of PageRank by a factor of 2 in realistic scenarios.  Further, we develop a variant of this algorithm that efficiently computes many different ``personalized'' PageRanks, and a variant that efficiently recomputes PageRank after node updates.},

We analytically compare three recent approaches to personalizing PageRank and discuss the tradeoffs of each one.},
